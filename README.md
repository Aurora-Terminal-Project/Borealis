# Borealis - A NeoVim Config

Borealis is my personal NeoVim configuration. It is designed to be an alternative to IDEs for efficiency and flexibility as well Git, Copilot and LSP integration.

## Features

- Plugin management with [Lazy.nvim]("https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim"),
- Pre-configured keymaps for an improved workflow,
- Auto-formatting and linting,
- Enhanced UI with themes, status line, and file explorer,
- Git integration with [LazyGit]("https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit") and [GitSigns]("https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim"),
- LSP support with [Mason]("https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim") and [LSPConfig]("https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig"),
- Multiple Plugins for better text manipulation and search,
